# Raspberry Pi Powered Smart Greenhouse
This repository contains the code for a Raspberry Pi-powered Smart Greenhouse, designed to remotely monitor, control, and predict environmental changes inside a greenhouse.

## Features
### Sensor Monitoring:

- DHT22 â€” Air temperature and humidity

- SHT20 â€” Soil temperature and humidity

- Water level sensor â€” For monitoring the water reservoir

### Remote Control:

- Open/close the greenhouse door

- Control the water pump

## AI Prediction Model:

An AI-powered model to predict plant water requirements (not included in this repository)
